#Customer Attrition Prediction Project
=====================================

This project focuses on predicting customer attrition (churn) using machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and historical data, the goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive retention measures.

Project Overview
----------------

The project includes the following components:

*   **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    *   Gathering and cleaning customer data to prepare it for analysis and modeling.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    *   Analyzing data to understand patterns, trends, and relationships using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
*   **Model Development**:
    *   Implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., RandomForest, SVM, Naive Bayes) using Scikit-learn to build predictive models.
*   **Evaluation and Model Selection**:
    *   Evaluating model performance based on metrics such as ROC AUC score and accuracy to select the best-performing model.
*   **Customer Segmentation and Retention Strategies**:
    *   Segmenting customers based on churn probability and devising retention strategies for high-risk customers.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Programming Languages**:
    *   Python
*   **Libraries and Frameworks**:
    *   Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and modeling
    *   Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
    *   Flask for building the user interface
*   **Development Environment**:
    *   Jupyter Notebook for prototyping and experimentation
    *   Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
